Scripts for running the CORPSE model:
CORPSE_array.py:	Defines the CORPSE model with up to 4 discrete microbial functional groups
CORPSE_solvers.py:	Functions for running the CORPSE model. Includes two approaches for running the model. One uses the python ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The other explicitly iterates the model using a fixed time step.
Whitman_sims.py:	This script is used to set initial post-burn parameters for CORPSE model. Includes up to four discrete microbial functional groups. Model can be run with fewer than 4 functional groups by setting MBC for a given pool equal to 0. 

These scripts have been tested using python 3.7.6 and the following packages:
matplotlib 3.1.2
pandas 0.25.3
numpy 1.17.3
scipy 1.4.1

One good way to install working versions of all these packages (if you don't already have them) is to install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Once you have the packages installed, you should be able to run the scripts and produce the plot of results by running:
python plots.py
