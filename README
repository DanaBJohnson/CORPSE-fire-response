Scripts for running the CORPSE model:
CORPSE_array.py:   Defines the CORPSE model

CORPSE_solvers.py: Functions for running the CORPSE model. 
                   Includes two approaches for running the model. One uses the python ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. 
                   The other explicitly iterates the model using a fixed time step.
                   
Whitman_sims.py:   This script was used for generating the preliminary figures and simulations from the DOE proposal, and can be a starting point
                   for developing new simulations for the project.
                   
                   
These scripts have been tested using python 3.7.6 and the following packages:
matplotlib 3.1.2
pandas 0.25.3
numpy 1.17.3
scipy 1.4.1

One good way to install working versions of all these packages (if you don't already have them) is to install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Once you have the packages installed, you should be able to run the scripts and produce the plot of results by running:
python Whitman_sims.py
